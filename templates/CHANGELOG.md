The following modules, previously considered experimental, are now stable and
safe for use on production sites, with full backwards compatibility and upgrade
paths from 8.4.0 to future releases:

* // That or we'll have to be adding a "Removed experimental modules" section.

## Third-party library updates

* [Drupal's Symfony dependency has been updated from Symfony 2.8 to Symfony
  3.2](https://www.drupal.org/node/2712647). This major version update is
  necessary because Symfony 2.8 support will end around the release of Drupal
  8.6.0 next year. [See the change record for information about Symfony 3 BC
  breaks that affected Drupal core](https://www.drupal.org/node/2743809).
  [Drupal 8 also requires Symfony 3.2.8](https://www.drupal.org/node/2871253)
  because of a bug in Symfony 3.2.7.
* [zendframework/zend-diactoros has been updated from 1.3.10 to 1.4.0](https://www.drupal.org/node/2874817).
