BLURB

This minor release provides new improvements and functionality without breaking backward compatibility (BC) for public APIs. There may be changes in internal APIs and experimental modules that require updates to contributed and custom modules and themes per <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/d8-bc-policy">Drupal core's backwards compatibility</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental">experimental module</a> policies.

Minor releases may include string changes and additions. Translators can <a href="https://localize.drupal.org/translate/drupal8">review the latest translation status on localize.drupal.org</a>.

<li>@todo List any issues in: https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=VERSION8+release+notes

Use the release notes snippet from the IS if one is provided.

If there is no release notes snippet, comment on the issue, tag it "Needs release note", and ping the issue contributors for them to write one. You can also help update and improve the release note on the issue before pasting it. See https://www.drupal.org/issue-summaries#release-notes for information and examples for writing good release notes.

Leave the issue link in while revising the release notes so committers can refer back to the issue, but remove it before publishing the release notes.

</li>
<li>@todo List any noteworthy CRs in: https://www.drupal.org/list-changes/drupal/published?keywords_description=&to_branch=BRANCH8 Tag them with the version release notes tag and ensure they have a release notes snippet.</li>
<li>@todo Check for added, removed, or changed dependencies. Committers seem to always forget to tag such issues for the release notes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Important bug fixes</h3>

The following critical issues are fixed in Drupal VERSION8:

Be sure not to include criticals that were backported -- sometimes the metadata on the issue is wrong. If you find a critical filed against NEXTBRANCH-dev that was backported to BRANCH8, set its branch to BRANCH-dev instead. If the issue is already listed above, you don't need to list it twice.</li>
