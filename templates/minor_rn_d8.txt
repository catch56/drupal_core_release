This minor release provides new improvements and functionality without breaking backward compatibility (BC) for public APIs. There may be changes in internal APIs and experimental modules that require updates to contributed and custom modules and themes per <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/d8-bc-policy">Drupal core's backwards compatibility</a> and <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental">experimental module</a> policies.

Minor releases may include string changes and additions. Translators can <a href="https://localize.drupal.org/translate/drupal8">review the latest translation status on localize.drupal.org</a>.
