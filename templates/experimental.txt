<h3>New experimental modules</h3>

<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental">Experimental modules</a> are provided with Drupal core for testing purposes, but are not yet fully supported.

<dl>
<dt>Workflows (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">alpha stability</a>)</dt>
<dd>
This module abstracts the transitions and states system from Content Moderation into a separate component so that it can be reused by other modules that implement non-publishing workflows.
</dd>

<dt>Layout Discovery (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">alpha stability</a>)</dt>
<dd>
Provides an API for modules or themes to register layouts. See the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2811175">layout roadmap</a> for the next steps for this module.
</dd>

<dt>Field Layout (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">alpha stability</a>)</dt>
<dd>
This module provides the ability for site builders to rearrange fields on content types, block types, etc. into new regions, for both the form and display, on the same forms provided by the normal field user interface. See the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2795833">entity display layout roadmap</a> for the next steps for this module.

<h3>Updated experimental features</h3>

The following modules are considered experimental for this release. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental">Experimental modules</a> are provided with Drupal core for testing purposes, but are not yet fully supported.

<dl>
<dt>Migrate (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#beta">beta stability</a>)</dt>
<dd>
As of 8.3.0, the <a href="https://groups.drupal.org/node/515916">Migrate API now has beta stability</a>, meaning that no future backwards-incompatible API changes are anticipated, so developers can leverage these APIs in custom migrations. Migrate will be considered completely stable after the issues tagged <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=Open&version%5B%5D=8.x&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=Migrate+critical">Migrate critical</a> are resolved, to ensure the base API fully supports critical functionality.
</li>
</dd>

<dt>Migrate Drupal and Migrate Drupal UI (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">alpha stability</a>)</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>Core provides migrations for most Drupal 6 data and can be used for migrating Drupal 6 sites to Drupal 8. The Drupal 6 to 8 migration path will enter beta stability once a <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2826047">critical issue with user picture IDs</a> is addressed. (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=1&status%5B%5D=13&status%5B%5D=8&status%5B%5D=14&status%5B%5D=15&status%5B%5D=4&issue_tags_op=%3D&issue_tags=migrate-d6-d8">Other outstanding issues for the Drupal 6 to Drupal 8 migration</a>)</li>
<li>The Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration is incomplete, but is suitable for developers who would like to help improve the migration, and can be used to test upgrades especially for simple Drupal 7 sites. Most high-priority migrations are already available. (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2456259">Outstanding issues for the Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 migration</a>)</li>
<li>Drush support is currently only available in the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_upgrade">Drupal Upgrade</code> contributed module. (See the <a href="https://github.com/drush-ops/drush/issues/2140>pull request to add support to Drush<a/>.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Content Moderation (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">alpha stability</a>)</dt>
<dd>Content Moderation allows content workflow states such as Draft, Archived, and Published, and now depends on the new experimental Workflows module (described above) to supply workflows and transitions for these states. See the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2833359">Workflows change record</a> for more information.

<strong>Important: If you previously installed Content Moderation in 8.2.x, you <em>must</em> uninstall it before upgrading to 8.3.0-alpha1 or you will encounter fatal errors.</strong> You will need to reconfigure your workflows and transitions with the new module after upgrading and re-enabling Content Moderation, so be sure to back them up beforehand. (No upgrade path is supplied since the module is still alpha stability.)

Content Moderation includes many additional improvements in this release:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2787881">#2787881: Non-translatable entity types can now be moderated.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2799785">#2799785: Entity types without bundles can be moderated, as long as they have revisions.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2809123">#2809123: When reverting a moderated revision, the moderation state is now reverted too.</a></li>
<li>The module now publishes any entity type that implements EntityPublishedInterface, not just Nodes.</li>
</ul>

See the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2755073">Content Moderation roadmap</a> for the next steps for this module.</dd>

<dt>Settings Tray (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">alpha stability</a>)</dt>
<dd>This is a prototype of Dries's proposed <a href="http://buytaert.net/tag/outside-in">Outside-In</a> usability enhancements. It allows configuring page elements such as blocks and menus from the frontend of your site. See the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2762505">roadmap of outstanding issues</a>, which includes both planned improvements and known accessibility and interaction bugs. The module is more polished in this release, but still considered alpha stability. It needs to become stable within the next six months to remain in core.</dd>

<dt>DateTime Range (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">alpha stability</a>)</dt>
<dd>The DateTime Range module provides a field type that allows end dates. This is important for contributed modules like the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/calendar">Calendar</a> module to work with Drupal 8 core. Contrib and site authors can begin working with the module so long as they are willing to manage the risks of <a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">using an alpha experimental module</a>. You can <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2788253">read the DateTime Range module plan</a> for the next steps to make this useful field a part of the Standard installation. This module needs to become stable within the next six months to remain in core.</dd>

<dt>Place Block (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">alpha stability</a>)</dt>
<dd>
This feature allows the user to place a block on any page and see the region where it will be displayed, without having to navigate to a backend administration form. <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2739075">The Place Block module needs to reach stability</a> within the next six months to remain in core.
</dd>

<dt>Inline Form Errors (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/core/experimental#alpha">alpha stability</a>)</dt>
<dd>
This provides a proof-of-concept for showing form errors inline for improved accessibility. Since the last minor release, important progress has been made on this module's has <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2504847">outstanding issues</a>. Help resolve the remaining issues on the roadmap to keep this module in Drupal core for 8.3.0.
