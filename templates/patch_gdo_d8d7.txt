Drupal 8 and 7 core release window on DATE, YEAR

The monthly core patch (bug fix) release window is this DATE. Drupal VERSION8 and VERSION7 will be released with fixes for Drupal 8 and 7.

To ensure a reliable release window for the patch release, there will be a Drupal BRANCH8 commit freeze from 12:00 UTC Tuesday to 12:00 UTC Thursday. Now is a good time to update your development/staging servers to the latest BRANCH8-dev or 7.x-dev code and help us catch any regressions in advance. If you do find any regressions, please report them in the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/issues/search/drupal?project_issue_followers=&status%5B%5D=Open&version%5B%5D=8.x&version%5B%5D=7.x&issue_tags_op=%3D">issue queue</a>. Thanks!
