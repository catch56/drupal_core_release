There are no known regressions in this release.

Drupal 8 currently has a number of known issues related to incorrect tracking of file usage, which can result in files being unexpectedly deleted from a site. (These issues also existed in 8.0.x and 8.1.x but have been recently discovered.) Site owners experiencing unexplained file loss should consider setting "Delete orphaned files" to "Never" on <code>/admin/config/media/file-system</code> until these issues are resolved, and note the following issues:
